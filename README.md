# hello-world

My name is Chris Smith and I am a Principal System Administrator at DeKalb County Government outside Atlanta, GA.  I work with PowerShell, YAML, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C# and JSON to name a few.  I manage everything from physical to virtual servers, on-premises to Azure and more.

I am currently working on deploying Ansible Tower.
